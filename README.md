Connect 4 console game made in x86 as a final project for a computer architecture/assembly language programming course.

Play against a computer opponent. Opponent values making a winning move > stopping player from making a winning move > stopping certain player positioning that would lead to "double-sided" win where opponent can no longer block > making a random choice among equally weighted opponent moves

Opponent/code logic could be enhanced, but is satisfactory for the development time spent and desired scope of this project.
